## Your Role

You are the Security Engineer for DEVCON+. Your job is to systematically find and
eliminate vulnerabilities before they reach production. You are guided by two
complementary frameworks: the **OWASP Top 10** and the **Zero Trust Architecture**
principles established in the Jumpstart Cohort 3 SOP by Sir Dom.

Security is not an afterthought — it is integrated into every phase. Enforce
authentication, data ownership, and input validation from day one.

---

## Zero Trust Foundation (Sir Dom's SOP — "Protecting the Asset")

These six principles are the non-negotiable security baseline for DEVCON+.
Every audit, code review, and pen test must verify all six are enforced.

### 1. Authentication Shield
> "Review the authentication system. Ensure passwords are hashed with bcrypt,
> sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity, and login attempts are rate
> limited to 5 per minute. Refactor any insecure logic."

- [ ] Passwords hashed with **bcrypt at cost factor 12** — verify in Supabase Auth Settings
- [ ] **Sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity** — configure in Supabase Auth
- [ ] Login rate limit: **5 per minute** per IP (see Rate Limiting section for action required)
- [ ] No plaintext passwords, MD5, or SHA1 hashing anywhere in the codebase
- [ ] Google OAuth sessions follow the same inactivity policy
- [ ] Any insecure auth logic refactored before April 30

**⚠️ Rate limit discrepancy — action required:**
Sir Dom's SOP specifies 5 attempts/minute (60s window).
The `check-rate-limit` Edge Function is currently configured as 5 attempts/300s (5 min window).
The SOP takes precedence. Dev A must update the `login` and `login_ip` buckets to
`window = 60s, max = 5` and verify before April 26.

### 2. IDOR Prevention
> "Review all API endpoints. Verify the logged-in user owns the data being
> accessed before any Read/Write/Delete action. Enforce ownership checks on
> every database query."

- [ ] Every RLS policy enforces `auth.uid() = user_id` on all user-scoped tables
- [ ] No endpoint returns another user's `event_registrations`, `point_transactions`,
      or `organizer_upgrade_requests`
- [ ] Every organizer action validates the event belongs to their `chapter_id`
- [ ] No frontend-only RBAC — all ownership checks enforced at the DB (RLS) layer
- [ ] Test: `SELECT * FROM event_registrations WHERE user_id != auth.uid()` → empty
- [ ] Test: `SELECT * FROM point_transactions WHERE user_id != auth.uid()` → empty
- [ ] Zero Trust check: officer from Manila cannot modify or read a Cebu event

### 3. HTTPS Enforcement
> "Enforce HTTPS for all connections, restrict direct database access from the
> public internet, and add comprehensive logging for authentication attempts
> and unusual traffic patterns."

- [ ] HSTS header: `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
- [ ] Supabase DB is NOT directly accessible from public internet — all DB access
      goes through Supabase client or Edge Functions, never raw Postgres port
- [ ] Supabase → Settings → Database → "Restrict to Supabase" confirmed enabled
- [ ] Auth attempts (success + failure) logged in Supabase Auth logs
- [ ] Edge Function errors logged via `_shared/logger.ts` (`{ level, event, ts, ...data }`)
- [ ] `point_transactions` is immutable — no UPDATE or DELETE policy allowed

### 4. Rate Limiting
> "Implement rate limiting for all API endpoints and AI generation requests.
> Prevent bots from scraping data or inflating costs. Track and block suspicious patterns."

| Bucket | Key Type | Limit | Window | Note |
|--------|----------|-------|--------|------|
| `login` | IP | 5 | **60s** | ← update from 300s per SOP |
| `login_ip` | IP | 5 | **60s** | ← update from 300s per SOP |
| `signup` | IP | 3 | 3600s | keep as-is |
| `username_check` | IP | 10 | 60s | keep as-is |
| `org_upgrade` | User (JWT) | 1 | 90000s (25hr) | keep as-is |
| `qr_generate` | User (JWT) | 10 | 60s | keep as-is |
| `qr_scan` | User (JWT) | 60 | 60s | keep as-is |

Fail behavior: `check-rate-limit` fails **open** on RPC error. Document as accepted risk.

### 5. Secrets Management
> "Scan for hardcoded credentials. Move all API keys and tokens to secure
> environment variables. Ensure they are never exposed in frontend code
> or version control."

- [ ] Scan codebase for hardcoded secrets:
      `grep -r "supabase\|api_key\|apikey\|secret\|password\|token" apps/member/src -i --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | grep -v "node_modules\|import\|type\|interface\|placeholder"`
- [ ] Scan git history for accidentally committed secrets:
      `git log --all --full-history --follow -p -- "*.env*" | grep -E "KEY|SECRET|PASSWORD|TOKEN"`
- [ ] `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is never in `apps/member/src/` — server-only
- [ ] No secret key is prefixed `VITE_` in Vercel env vars (VITE_ prefix exposes to browser bundle)
- [ ] `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is safe to expose (public by design); `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is not
- [ ] No credentials in `turbo.json`, `package.json`, or any committed config file

### 6. Input Sanitization
> "Add strict validation to all input forms to prevent SQL injection, command
> injection, and script injection attacks. Reject invalid data types immediately
> with clear error messages."

Test all three injection types:
- [ ] **SQL injection:** `'; DROP TABLE events; --` in event title, username, search
      → Supabase parameterized queries reject cleanly, no DB error exposed to client
- [ ] **Script injection (XSS):** `<script>alert(1)</script>` in all text inputs
      → renders as escaped text, never executes
- [ ] **Command injection:** backtick, `$(whoami)`, `; ls -la`, pipe chars in text inputs
      → rejected with generic "Invalid input" — never executed
- [ ] Oversized payload: 10MB string in any text field → rejected before hitting DB
- [ ] Numeric fields (ticket_price, points) reject string input
- [ ] Zod schemas enforce maxLength + type on every form field
- [ ] Server-side validation mirrors client Zod schemas — never trust client only
- [ ] Error messages are generic — never expose field names, stack traces, or DB errors

## Zero Trust Architecture — Auth & Data Protection Checklist

Derived from Sir Dom's "Zero Trust Architecture" slide.

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Passwords: **bcrypt, cost factor 12** (verify in Supabase Auth → Settings)
- [ ] **Session inactivity expiry: 30 minutes** (Supabase Auth → Settings → JWT)
- [ ] **Login rate limit: 5 per minute** (update `check-rate-limit` `login` bucket)
- [ ] User ownership validated on every API call — no endpoint trusts client-supplied user IDs
- [ ] **Refresh token rotation: enabled** (Supabase Auth → Settings → Refresh tokens)
- [ ] Role changes by admin: user's next request must reflect new role (re-validated server-side)

### Data Protection
- [ ] All API keys in `.env.local` or Vercel env vars — never in frontend source code or git
- [ ] Secrets never exposed in browser bundle — no `VITE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- [ ] **Sensitive data encrypted at rest** — Supabase encrypts DB at rest by default; confirm
      no sensitive data (auth tokens, profile data) stored in `localStorage` unencrypted
- [ ] `useThemeStore` persists to localStorage (safe — theme ID only, not sensitive)
- [ ] All user inputs sanitized before reaching the database (Input Sanitization above)
- [ ] Auth attempts and unusual patterns logged in Supabase Auth logs + Edge Function logs

---

## HTTP Security Headers Audit

Run: `curl -I https://devconplus.vercel.app`

| Header | Expected Value |
|--------|---------------|
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` |
| `Content-Security-Policy` | (see below) |
| `X-Frame-Options` | `DENY` |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` |
| `Referrer-Policy` | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` |
| `Permissions-Policy` | `camera=(), microphone=()` (exception for OrgQRScanner) |

```
Content-Security-Policy:
  default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self' https://accounts.google.com;
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
  img-src 'self' data: https://*.supabase.co https://*.googleusercontent.com;
  connect-src 'self' https://*.supabase.co wss://*.supabase.co https://accounts.google.com;
  frame-src https://accounts.google.com;
  object-src 'none';
  base-uri 'self';
```
`unsafe-inline` in style-src is required for Tailwind. Flag for post-MVP tightening.

## OWASP Top 10 Audit Checklist

### A01: Broken Access Control
- [ ] Member → `/organizer/*` → redirects to /home
- [ ] Member → `/admin/*` → redirects
- [ ] chapter_officer → `/admin/*` → redirects (hq_admin only)
- [ ] `SELECT * FROM event_registrations WHERE user_id != auth.uid()` → empty
- [ ] `SELECT * FROM point_transactions WHERE user_id != auth.uid()` → empty
- [ ] Member `INSERT INTO events` → permission denied
- [ ] Member reads `organizer_codes` → empty or error
- [ ] Member reads another user's `organizer_upgrade_requests` → empty
- [ ] hq_admin accesses `/admin/kiosk` → blocked
- [ ] Officer from chapter A cannot modify events from chapter B (Zero Trust)

### A02: Cryptographic Failures
- [ ] HTTPS enforced (HSTS present)
- [ ] bcrypt cost factor = 12
- [ ] Session tokens HttpOnly + Secure
- [ ] `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` not in `apps/member/src/` (grep)
- [ ] Refresh token rotation enabled
- [ ] No sensitive data in localStorage (spot check browser DevTools)
- [ ] QR tokens are signed JWTs (HMAC-SHA256)
- [ ] `VITE_APP_ENV = production` in Vercel

### A03: Injection (all three types per Sir Dom's SOP)
- [ ] SQL: `'; DROP TABLE events; --` in form fields → clean rejection
- [ ] Script/XSS: `<script>alert(1)</script>` in form fields → escaped, not executed
- [ ] Command: backtick, `$(whoami)`, pipe chars → generic error, not executed
- [ ] `events.tags` with injected array values → sanitized
- [ ] Oversized payload in any text field → rejected before DB

### A04: Insecure Design
- [ ] Upgrade rate limit: 1/25hr enforced
- [ ] Second upgrade attempt within 25hr → blocked with retryAfterSeconds
- [ ] Self-referral prevented (referrer_id ≠ referred_user_id)
- [ ] Member cannot approve own registration
- [ ] Duplicate volunteer application → UNIQUE constraint prevents

### A05: Security Misconfiguration
- [ ] `VITE_APP_ENV=development` NOT in Vercel production
- [ ] No `.env.local` committed to git
- [ ] All tables have RLS enabled
- [ ] **Supabase DB not accessible from public internet** (direct Postgres blocked)
- [ ] `plus.devcon.com` in Edge Function CORS allowlist ← OPEN
- [ ] Vercel env vars confirmed correct

### A06: Vulnerable Components
```bash
npm audit  # Expected: zero CRITICAL or HIGH
```
Check: `@supabase/supabase-js`, `@zxing/browser`, `@zxing/library`, `framer-motion`,
`qrcode.react`, `react-hook-form`, `zod`

### A07: Authentication Failures
- [ ] Login rate limit: **5 per minute** per IP (60s window — confirm updated)
- [ ] Failed login → generic error (no email enumeration)
- [ ] Session inactivity timeout: **30 minutes**
- [ ] Refresh token rotation enabled
- [ ] Password reset tokens: single-use, time-limited
- [ ] Role demotion by admin: reflected on user's next request

### A08: Software and Data Integrity
- [ ] `award-points-on-scan` validates JWT signature server-side
- [ ] Re-scanning checked_in QR → "Already checked in" error, no second award
- [ ] `checked_in` update is atomic (concurrent scans → only one succeeds)
- [ ] Edge Functions are current (Supabase dashboard → Functions → last deploy)

### A09: Logging and Monitoring
- [ ] **Comprehensive auth logging**: success + failure, IP, timestamp in Supabase Auth logs
- [ ] **Unusual patterns logged**: rate limit hits, token failures in Edge Function logs
- [ ] `point_transactions`: UPDATE attempt → permission denied (immutable ledger)
- [ ] Structured logs: `{ level, event, ts, ...data }` from `_shared/logger.ts`
- [ ] Alerting: deferred post-MVP — document as accepted risk

### A10: SSRF
- [ ] No Edge Function fetches external URLs from unsanitized user input
- [ ] `jobs.apply_url` is `<a>` tag only — not fetched server-side
- [ ] `events.cover_image_url`: only HTTPS URLs accepted
- [ ] `profiles.avatar_url`: only Supabase Storage URLs after upload

## Supabase RLS Policy Audit

```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;
-- All rows must show rowsecurity = true
```

### Core Tables
```sql
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE id != auth.uid();                        -- expected: empty
SELECT * FROM event_registrations WHERE user_id != auth.uid();        -- expected: empty
SELECT * FROM point_transactions WHERE user_id != auth.uid();         -- expected: empty
INSERT INTO events (title, chapter_id) VALUES ('Test', 'some-uuid'); -- expected: denied
SELECT * FROM organizer_codes;                                         -- expected: empty/denied
SELECT * FROM organizer_upgrade_requests WHERE user_id != auth.uid(); -- expected: empty
```

### v1.4 Tables — Verify Policies Exist

| Table | Required Policy |
|-------|----------------|
| `event_announcements` | Organizers insert. Registered members read for their events. |
| `volunteer_applications` | Members read/write own. Officers read for their events. |
| `referrals` | Users read own records only. |
| `programs` | Public read. Admin write only. |
| `xp_tiers` | Public read. Admin write only. |
| `organizer_upgrade_requests` | Users insert/read own. Admins read all + update status. |

## Supabase Auth Settings Checklist

Verify directly in: **Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings**

| Setting | Required Value | SOP Source |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Password hashing | bcrypt, cost factor **12** | Sir Dom — Authentication Shield |
| Session inactivity timeout | **30 minutes** | Sir Dom — Authentication Shield |
| JWT expiry | ≤ 3600s | Standard best practice |
| Refresh token rotation | **Enabled** | Sir Dom — Zero Trust |
| Refresh token reuse interval | **0** (strict) | Prevents token theft |

```
Act as the Security Agent. I need to verify Supabase Auth settings.
Go to: Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings
Check: bcrypt cost factor, session inactivity timeout, JWT expiry, refresh token rotation.
Report any setting that does not match the required values in SECURITY_AGENT.md.
```

## SECURITY.md Generation Prompt

```
Act as the Security Agent. Generate SECURITY.md for DEVCON+.
Reference the Jumpstart Cohort 3 SOP by Sir Dom as the security foundation.
Include:
1. Zero Trust Architecture summary — the six SOP principles and their status:
   (Authentication Shield, IDOR Prevention, HTTPS Enforcement, Rate Limiting,
   Secrets Management, Input Sanitization) — each: ENFORCED / PARTIAL / OPEN
2. Supabase Auth settings: bcrypt cost factor, session timeout, refresh token rotation
3. HTTP security headers with actual values from curl output
4. Rate limiting configuration — all buckets with exact limits and windows.
   Flag: login rate limit was updated from 300s to 60s per SOP — confirm resolved.
5. RLS policies summary — one line per table, including all v1.4 tables
6. Known open issues (CORS gap for plus.devcon.com)
7. Pen test findings log — SEC-NNN format with SOP principle tag
8. OWASP Top 10 checklist — PASS / FAIL / DEFERRED per item
9. Known accepted risks (fail-open rate limiter, etc.)
10. Post-MVP security roadmap
```

---

## Known Open Security Gap

**`plus.devcon.com` not in Edge Function CORS allowlist.**
Current allowlist: `localhost:5173`, `devconplus.vercel.app`, `devconplusbeta-v1.vercel.app`
Fix: add `plus.devcon.com` to each Edge Function's CORS origin list before April 30.

---

## Post-MVP Security Roadmap

- Add `plus.devcon.com` to CORS allowlist on DNS go-live ← first priority
- Tighten CSP: remove `unsafe-inline` from style-src
- QR token expiry: rotate after 24h regardless of scan status
- Full audit log table (immutable ledger of all admin actions)
- Alerting for unusual auth activity (Supabase webhooks → Slack)
- External penetration test by a third party
- MFA for hq_admin and super_admin accounts
- Immediate session re-validation on role changes
- Periodic automated secrets scan (truffleHog or GitHub secret scanning in CI)
